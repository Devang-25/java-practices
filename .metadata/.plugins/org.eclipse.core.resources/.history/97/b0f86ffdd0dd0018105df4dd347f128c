	 * All modern operating systems support concurrency both via processes and
	 * threads. Processes are instances of programs which typically run independent
	 * to each other, e.g. if you start a java program the operating system spawns a
	 * new process which runs in parallel to other programs. Inside those processes
	 * we can utilize threads to execute code concurrently, so we can make the most
	 * out of the available cores of the CPU.
	 * 
	 * Before starting a new thread you have to specify the code to be executed by
	 * this thread, often called the task. This is done by implementing Runnable - a
	 * functional interface defining a single void no-args method run() as
	 * demonstrated in the following example:
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Due to concurrent execution we cannot predict if the runnable will be invoked
	 * before or after printing 'done'. The order is non-deterministic, thus making
	 * concurrent programming a complex task in larger applications.
	 * 
	 * TimeUnit is a useful enum for working with units of time.

	 * Executors# The Concurrency API introduces the concept of an ExecutorService

	 * internal pool will be reused under the hood for revenant tasks, so we can run
	 * as many concurrent tasks as we want throughout the life-cycle of our
	 * application with a single executor service.
	 * 
	 * This is how the first thread-example looks like using executors:
	 * 
	 * An ExecutorService provides two methods to stop exectorservice: shutdown()
	 * stop taking new tasks but let current running task to complete.
	 * 
	 * shutdownNow() interrupts all running tasks and shut the executor down
	 * immediately.
	 * 
	 * awaitTermination wait for the given period to timeout if any running task.
	 * After a maximum of given timee the executor finally shuts down by
	 * interrupting all running tasks.

	 * This lambda expression defines a callable returning an integer after sleeping
	 * for one second:
	 * 
	 * submit() doesn't wait until the task completes, the executor service cannot
	 * return the result of the callable directly. Instead the executor returns a
	 * special result of type Future which can be used to retrieve the actual result
	 * at a later point in time.
	 * 
	 * After submitting the callable to the executor we first check if the future
	 * has already been finished execution via isDone().
	 * 
	 * Calling the method get() blocks the current thread and waits until the
	 * callable completes before returning the actual result.

	 * 
	 * In order to test this behavior we use this helper method to simulate

	 * for a certain amount of time until returning the given result:
	 * 
	 * We use this method to create a bunch of callables with different durations
	 * from one to three seconds. Submitting those callables to an executor via
	 * invokeAny() returns the string result of the fastest callable - in that case
	 * task2:
	 * 
	 * 
	 * The example uses yet another type of executor created via
	 * newWorkStealingPool(). This factory method is part of Java 8 and returns an
	 * executor of type ForkJoinPool which works slightly different than normal
	 * executors. Instead of using a fixed size thread-pool ForkJoinPools are
	 * created for a given parallelism size which per default is the number of
	 * available cores of the hosts CPU.

	 * Scheduled Executors# In order to periodically run common tasks multiple

	 * 
	 * A ScheduledExecutorService is capable of scheduling tasks to run either
	 * periodically or once after a certain amount of time has elapsed.
	 * 
	 * This code sample schedules a task to run after an initial delay of three
	 * seconds has passed:
	 * 
	 * ScheduledFuture which - in addition to Future - provides the method
	 * getDelay() to retrieve the remaining delay. After this delay has elapsed the
	 * task will be executed concurrently.
	 * 
	 * In order to schedule tasks to be executed periodically, executors provide the
	 * two methods scheduleAtFixedRate() and scheduleWithFixedDelay(). The first
	 * method is capable of executing tasks with a fixed time rate
	 * 
	 * Please keep in mind that scheduleAtFixedRate() doesn't take into account the
	 * actual duration of the task. So if you specify a period of one second but the
	 * task needs 2 seconds to be executed then the thread pool will working to
	 * capacity very soon.
	 * 
	 * In that case you should consider using scheduleWithFixedDelay() instead. This
	 * method works just like the counterpart described above. The difference is
	 * that the wait time period applies between the end of a task and the start of
	 * the next task.
