	 	1) given a list of string infix of operation. return postfix of operation of strings.
	 	 eg: c+a*b : infix -> +c*ab, return postfix -> cab*+
	 	 
	 	 2) given a list of quantities and a list of thier cost for corresponding quantity in differnt store. For a given 
	 	 amount n, find the maximum quantity we can get. quantity in stores are unlimited.
	 	 
	 	 3) given a 2d array with n*m dimention. cells contain 1 if there is way or 0 if it is blocked. 
	 	 find all possible path to reach n-1,m-1 from 0,0.
	 	 4) sql join query group by count
	 	 5) given an array of integers. there is sequence between two numbers if their any digit match. 
	 	 find longest such seq length. Also find that sequence array
	 	 6) given an array of integers. for size 1 to n=length of array, get minimum of that size combination and 
	 	 then take max of that min array. return result of that max array.
	 	 eg: [1,5,6,2,8,9,7]
	 	 	1: 1,5,6,2,8,9,7 : max= 9
	 	 	2: 1,5,2,2,8,7: max= 8
	 	 	3: 1,2,2,2, : max:7
	 	 	4: 1,2,2,2	: max: 2
	 	 	5: 1,2,2: max:2
	 	 	6:1, 2 : max: 2
	 	 	7: 1     max:1
	 	 	
	 	 	7) design bitly: architecture, data flow, schema, api, storage/cache, scaling
	 	 	why cassandra, how it works. how redis works. why not sql or mongodb. 
	 	 	how key generation service will generate unique key. how key generation service is working.
